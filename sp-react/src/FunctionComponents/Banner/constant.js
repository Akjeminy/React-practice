    ATTEND: `Formal written contracts establish the legal relationship between the parties; they state the terms and conditions of that relationship and the rights and obligations of each party. They confirm the intentions and relationships of the parties as they enter into this relationship, and they eliminate uncertainties regarding mutual rights, obligations, and relationships. If everything remained as it is at the time the agreement is signed, there would be little need for formal documents. However, the agreement serves to protect against future disputes. Therefore, it should include as precise language as possible. 

    Ambiguous terms in agreements are of little effect when disputes occur over the meaning of a party's rights or obligations. You should attend to gain an understanding of what should and what should not be in a physician employment agreement.
    Understand the language in terms used in Physician employment agreements.
    Avoid mistakes commonly made by Physicians and their employers when entering into employment agreements; and
    Understand what to look for when entering into an employment agreement and avoid potential pitfalls.`,
